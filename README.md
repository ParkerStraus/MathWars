# Math Wars
##A Game By Parker Straus

You are flying through space. The only thing stopping you from getting to where you going is a bunch of random asteroids. There's only one way to stop them: ARITHMETIC. Using the power of basic math problems, shoot the asteroid out of space! 

Some interesting features of this game:

 - High Score System
 - Gradual increase in difficulty
 - Save and Load progress
 - An Item Shop

This was a project from an early class back in university. This to me is a very early milestone that help compare my growth as a software engineer.
